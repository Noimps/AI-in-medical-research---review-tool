Read the attached PDF and produce a structured IRB ML ethics review for the five principles:
Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, Autonomy, Justice, Explicability.

For each principle:
- Quote or summarize the relevant statement(s) from the PDF with exact page numbers.
- Raise 1–3 critical, decision-driving questions per item.
- Where appropriate, add concise comparator notes referencing existing peer-reviewed medical ML papers or recognized guidelines (with DOI/PubMed ID or guideline name & year). If none can be confidently cited, state “Comparative evidence needed”.

Keep it concise, precise, and suitable for expert readers.
